Problem Statement:

The speed of sound in water varies as a function of the medium's density; temperature, salinity, and depth (head) all contribute to variations in density and must be measured to calculate the speed of sound at a given location. In order to understand how the speed of sound changes in the ocean at a single location through various depths, CTD instruments are used to take measurements of temperature, conductivity, and pressure as they dive and surface between set depths.
