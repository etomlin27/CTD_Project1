Problem Statement:

The speed of sound in water varies as a function of the medium's density; temperature, salinity, and depth (head) all contribute to variations in density and must be measured to calculate the speed of sound at a given location. In order to understand how the speed of sound changes in the ocean at a single location through various depths, CTD instruments are used to take measurements of temperature, conductivity, and pressure as they dive and surface between set depths. These can be fed into the speed of sound equation at each data point to develop a speed of sound profile vs. depth using equation (1). These profiles can then be analyzed graphically to determine how seasonal, hourly, and geographic variables affect the profile.

  Equation 1:     1449.2 + 4.6(T) - 0.055(T^2) + 0.00029(T^3) + (1.34 - 0.01(T)) + 0.016Z
  Where: T = temperature in degrees Celsius and Z = depth in meters
